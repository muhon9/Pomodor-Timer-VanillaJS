This is a vanilall js boilerplate configured wtih webpack. It can be used to develop any vanilla js project and build a production ready minified code. It will work with CSS, Sass, PostCss, 

It was a webpack learing project mainly. I tried to apply all the knowledges and techniques i found on internet. I started with webpack documentation tutorial and added different plugins as my need. I have taken a lot of concepts from various content.
