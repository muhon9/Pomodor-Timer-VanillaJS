## üéØ About

I started this mini project during my Webpack learning. Main goal was to see how webpack builds it.
As i am not comfortable making a modular app with Vanilla JS only i kept all the functionality in index file.
Using only vanilla JS to write a mini fully functional app was fun

## Webpack

I used my Vanilla JS Webpack Boilerplate to use as Development Server and Build Tool. If you are interested only on Vanilla JS part you can see only the index.html, index.js and style.css files. The rest are Webpack things
